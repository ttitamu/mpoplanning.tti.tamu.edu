        <dt><a name="istea"></a>Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA)</dt>
        <dd>A Transportation Bill passed by Congress in 1991 that provides six year authorizations for development of a National Intermodal Transportation System which consists of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner. It increased the percentage of federal match funding available for the majority of Texas transportation projects. <abbr title="Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act">ISTEA</abbr> was designed to move goods and people more efficiently by developing an integrated transportation infrastructure system for the United States. <abbr title="Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act">ISTEA</abbr> is this country's first serious effort to promote intermodalism, the idea that all systems and structures for moving people and goods must function as an integrated and cohesive transportation network which includes rail and mass transit as well as highways. Under <abbr title="Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act">ISTEA</abbr>, the statewide planning process must incorporate some new goals: to reduce congestion and improve air quality; to consider national and international commerce; to consider energy conservation; to create an integrated system of several modes; and to concentrate on the most efficient way to move goods and people, not just people. The three major components of <abbr title="Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act">ISTEA</abbr> are the <a href="glossary.html#nhs">National Highway System</a>, the Surface Transportation Program, and the <a href="glossary.html#cmaq">Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program</a>.</dd>

        <dt><a name="los"></a>Level Of Service (LOS)</dt>
        <dd>A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream and motorists' perceptions of those conditions. For example, <abbr title="Level Of Service">LOS</abbr> A represents free flow, almost complete freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream. <abbr title="Level Of Service">LOS</abbr> F represents forced flow, more vehicles are attempting to use the freeway than can be served resulting in stop and go traffic.</dd>
                
        <dt><a name="mpo"></a>Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)</dt>
        <dd>An association of local agencies established for mutual benefit and to help coordinate planning and development activities within a metropolitan region.

<ol>
  <li>The Policy board is comprised of officials representing the counties, cities, and state agency.</li>
  <li>The technical advisory group consists of professional planners and engineers who are usually employees of the same agencies.</li>
</ol>

The <abbr title="Metropolitan Planning Organization">MPO</abbr> is not a level of government. However, the <abbr title="Metropolitan Planning Organization">MPO</abbr> has "effective control" over transportation improvements within the area since a project must be a part of the <abbr title="Metropolitan Planning Organization's">MPO's</abbr> adopted plan in order to receive federal funding.</dd>
        
        <dt><a name="nhs"></a>National Highway System (NHS)</dt>
        <dd>The <abbr title="National Highway System">NHS</abbr> is one of the three major components of the 1991 <a href="glossary.html#istea">Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act</a>.

        <dt><a name="vc"></a>Volume-to-Capacity (V/C) Ratio</dt>
        <dd>The ratio of flow rate to capacity. The <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratio may be the actual or projected rate of flow on a designated lane group during a peak 15-minute interval divided by the capacity of the lane group. The <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratio is a measure of capacity sufficiency, that is, whether or not the physical geometry provides sufficient capacity for the subject movement. Low <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratios depict relatively free flow conditions. High <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratios depict more congested conditions. Actual <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratios are calculated from vehicle count data (defining volume) and the geometrics of a roadway (determining capacity). <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratios are used to broadly define problem areas on a freeway and to make preliminary operational decisions concerning the freeway (e.g., ramp metering rates). In some cases, the <abbr title="Volume-to-Capacity">V/C</abbr> ratio is used to define <a href="glossary.html#los">Level of Service</a>.</dd>
        
        <dt><a name="wa"></a>Weaving Area</dt>
        <dd>A section of a highway where two or more vehicle flows must cross each other's path along a length of the freeway. Weaving areas are usually formed when merge areas are closely followed by diverging areas. They are also formed when a freeway on-ramp is followed by an off-ramp and the two are connected by a continuous auxiliary lane.</dd>
